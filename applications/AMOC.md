42_DigitalNomads

- **Payment Address:**¬†
To get coins is fine, but I have only on one account a visa card attached to use what comes in. 
Did polkadot have also any wallet with physical and virtual visa cards? 
Otherwise feel free to find our "drunken airdrop bot" and get direct on top some projects coins back.

- Level 2-3

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Buschland will be a place to hangout, meet friends, and play games together on the floor. 
A bit the same way as in the old times the kings played chess on the floor with human sized figures.
As a start we will do a Cannabis Card Game AMOC in Buschland. Later other games will become part of the game.
For this we have now six face card templates with 1.000 Breeder >> 20.000 Strains ¬†>> out of this 42M Phenotypes.
All Card data are stored in a single file, to have no external content in them, to guarantee a max. code lifetime. 


### Overview

- Cannabis, Communication, Gaming, Trading, Making & Blockchain.

- Buschland a Cannabis multiuser world UE5 on linux pixel streaming. (Anyday also as Matrix widget)

Buschland will be a place to hangout, meet and make new friends, play games together, listen musik, and have fun. 
But also it will be a global canna makerspace for projecting & ideas around the canna industry.
I did think for a long time, a bit the same way as the [c-base](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-base) but about cannabis & canna tec, global virtual.

My absolute first try out to build a "Online Cannabis Chat City" was this.

![First tryout background art](https://amoc.info/about/HanfhausenBabylonBerlin.jpg)

It was however really complex to display a big internet with 50k modems.
Also it was not possible to run video chat on "Sony-Ericsson Phones" in this old times.
I think, that meanwhile this alien planet have the right hardware for all this. 
So we must not play as normal a card game on a table with cams around it.

It is much smarter to have a 3D OpenWorld UE5, and all can play games together in an open world.
So our cards can do walking, and in the world will be placed different game-zones for the player to play.
Also we will do stepwise adding a lot of other games this way. :) 

As a start we will do our Cannabis Card Game AMOC in it.
For this we have now "6_face card templates" with 1.000 Breeder >> 20.000 Strains ¬†>> out of this 42M Phenotypes Seeds.
All Card data are stored in a single file, to have no external content. To guarantee a max. code lifetime. 
The breeder_logo orders the colors for Txt & Effect_Colors.
All table value_colors fit to the collection end range of 42M.
For the breeding functions we must add some values anyway also in the missing metadata.. :/

The 3D frontend part for it will be looking this direction.

## Is your favorite strain also in?

https://buschland.eu/CardList/cardlist.html
Use the mousewheel for zoom in/out.
Click at the "Golden Card Corners" to enter the next pages 6x.
! It is a Pre_Alpha. And still in construction. So please do not BBQ us for the syntax & design.
Here is a card with data in all 6 pages.
[Game card example](https://buschland.eu/cards/S/Sensi_Seeds/Super_Skunk/Sensi_Seeds__Super_Skunk.html)
Here a card with fallback for no "effect-page" data given.
[Game card fallback example](https://buschland.eu/cards/0-9/00_Seeds_Bank/00_Kush/00_Seeds_Bank__00_Kush.html)


Of course, as a dolphin I have no clue about dynamic multichain metadata constructs and game contracts. :/

I prepared some confusing chaos organograms and also a tiny construct to have filenames and functions to think about, and how to split in about 80 contracts or less..
No clue if this prepaire has any sense or will be handy, but I hope it is better to have some words than to have nothing.

The idea behind is to start a knot in the cannabis industry with gaming and blockchain.
Canna EXPO, training, information, shopping, all the normal madness + building a global community gow system together... 
I guess... It is about 42 Years of projects in front of me. (..Step by Step).

## Background

Our Avatar, an alien in the form of a cannabis leaf.
It comes with a transform, to transform by "onclick" his face into a video_chat_display. *Matrix chat. 
It also comes with emotions, that means the mesh is also prepared to show emotions also as color from emotion synthesizer plugin.
On top we add a funny looking flight mod.
I think it's "cute", and so I hope you like it too.

[![Video of avatar creating](https://amoc.info/about/rigpreview.mp4.png)](https://amoc.info/about/rigpreview.mp4)

"OH" by this textline fit in a funny fact...
Our Avatar is so young, that he is still by learning to walk.
And we send him to a DANCE Contest... ü§£
PLEASE give us some ‚ù§Ô∏è VOTES and Shares for the dance competition.
THANKS a LOT ++ üôÇ

Matrix will be our ingame communication system. 
Also for the game & project support and team intern.
https://42.chat
Still thinking about a Matrix_Wallet-Login. :/
Later the Buschland world PixelStreaming, will be also running as Matrix-Widget. "2322"
Actually this GPU linux game server does hate me hard. :/

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

PolkaDot knows a lot about all this multichain stuff for coins & cards.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

I, as an old cannabis pioneer, love to work with cannabis related stuff.


### Project Details

- Mockups/designs of any UI components:

Our 3D CardCatalog frontend... ;)
But from the video, a freelancer builds, sends it, and runs away.
Now I know why... 
He delivered a 12GB 3D frontend for the 450GB content as .uproject_windows.
But he knows that we need .uproject_linux. 
So again one step backwards... :(



- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

Data models, API, black_vodoo sounds as a plan. 

- An overview of the technology stack to be used:

Don't know, 4 root servers, 11 IP's, some domains, some VM's, most ubuntu`s 22.04 one deb min. A4000 with AmpereV3 for is IF our basic idea bounced too can run video chat on tensorcores...

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

"docu" time for that perhaps in beta.. we are Pre_Alpha! All changed faster as anyone can do docs..
If, IF anyday, all is running, then we can form a nice docu.


- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

PoC is the Phone operating Center on camp.. "hmmm"..

- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement

No scam, no ponzi, no shit click click game, no play better for richkids, 99% of all what other name a game, i do not like to do. 

¬† - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
¬† Help, SoS, Mayday, I need a team, structure, cash till our fundraise, AND after this moment help to run solidity hackertons and START with all the side projects.
¬† Cannabis & Computer starts both with the letter "C".
¬† But it looks as if it is much harder for a cannabis pro to learn coding, as for a computer pro to learn smoking. ¬†:()


- The (future) tokenomics of your project 

You are talking about the use case and sense of our token to let them spin..?
This is too much text for here.
It comes from ingame assets till ingame marketing, seeds_selling, game marketplace with canna artists, events and physical events, also all upcoming projects out of this buschland makerspace project smithers world ...

- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

I talked with some big-player for seeds, all of them agreed to deliver our sales with physical game_card-packing.
Also all will love to run on global trade shows monthly "events" with her products and the game. And a lot more..
For this we do later develop events, software, special hardware_kits, and have the plan to roll out for evers breeder & strain a coin.
These coins will be also anyway feeded from game actions as "burning game cards".
Same as in our buschcoin contract the 5% reduction tax, will be by burning a card part from it going to all the same card holder, and the other part goes into the breeder/strain token.
// Let's test what happens if we blast this amount of coin contracts by database into a chain... :()


### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
I think as a dolphin to understand, PolkaDot is for multi chain and multi ecosystems for the future of blockchain.
For us as a game we must be open to all chains and ecosystems. 

In the old times, the first who was nice and fair talking to us, was binance bsc.
I know (!), a lot say binance is no real chain, binance is a shit, binance this binance that. I am a bit sad to hear this so often.
Binance is also a part of the blockchain evolution, and together means not -1. 
We have an old LaunchPadContract from below corona times. 
But we lost in corona ALL, so lost the startUpoffice in barcelona, server, domains, mails, data.. and now i am by project restart_II.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's user base, yourself)?

A student freelancer startet the buschcoins erc bsc, and the coinbot for airdrop was a x-mass gift.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

Perhaps at first a solidity crew. 
Then a CEO and CTO, + about 12 department directors, and 42 real good people as a team.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

Of course not.

¬† - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

¬† Not in this direction.

### Team's experience

I know about the cannabis industry.

Sad that my interviews are all not in english. :(
"Here I get announced" as the oldest pioneer, much longer as don johann or the reporter as known as oldest reporter..

## Development Status :open_book:


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:


### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
This will be never ending. 42 years.

- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 

To come to a start, to have metadata, game, contracts and ALL, "wait i ask my "magic crystal ball".
I read from people that they are writing a tiny marketplace in one weekend.¬†And others need a month of time.
For 3D and Web and Solidity i GUESS 5 people 1 nerd_month time. So a lot of mate-less sleep.
To find the right people is also time, and to recognize IF they really CAN do what they say...

- **Total Costs:** 

Till the startline is passed it is about 1.500 for hardware and domains. Month by Month... 
+ the 5 team for 1-2 month 30-60k, + about 25k for launchpad_charitee fee, + about 20k for marketing for the start. 



### Milestone 1 Example ‚Äî Basic functionality

..I diced numbers...

- **Estimated duration:** 2 month
- **FTE:** ¬†10
- **Costs:** 108,000 USD

I think, after the launchpad we can finance all what we need to compleate all parts in BETA..
And we will have then also a stable cool blockchain game & app dev crew. 


## Future Plans

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term.
As descriptet, most comes from tradeshows and events.
For the start some game & blockchain blogs and news reports. 

- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.
However I plan, corona kills plants faster.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Web3 Foundation Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.
First from the event from Jonan on c-base.
Then in the Matrix PolkaDot Watercooler.
And after muddlebee cared about me with this link..


- Work you have already done.

..Friends say it's a LOT, I say it's all only some first drafts.

- If there are any other teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project.
Some friends will be part and get by launching cards/coins/surprise/ and will be welcome in the team.
The Last 10 years are self financed and sure getting some donations and free pizzas from the community.

- Previous grants you may have applied for.

I think to all, but by the word "cannabis" also all direct do running away.

- Coolest feature in BETA will be:

That in a card game, also in a card marketplace in some situations as in "play-rounds" & "search_results" cards come in a "flow".
They come in a line as motorbikes on a racing track one after the other.
So this is anyway perfect to include a part from the old musician "Mozart".
Did you remember 200 years ago it was popular to play games such as "Dice2Compose_Music".
So under the line it's no magic to run a later contest for music artists to bring Akkords for the "system", get voted, win prizes... ...
For this we have "some" time to think about.
It is an easy job to do this with "Walz & Piano", but we like dub.
So I hope later it is the first game & market with music composed from "using it".
Logo for the marketplace is done.
